# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-CNN
This repository contains the implementation of brain tumor detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Two models have been employed for this task: EfficientNet and a custom-built CNN. The dataset used for training and testing the models is included in the repository.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is provided in the dataset directory. It contains MRI images of brain tumors along with their corresponding labels indicating the presence or absence of a tumor.
